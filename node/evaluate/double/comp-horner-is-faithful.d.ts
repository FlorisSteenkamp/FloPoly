/**
 * Returns the result of evaluating a univariate polynomial using once compensated
 * Horner's method, including a dynamic check for faithfull rounding and a
 * certified running error bound.
 *
 * * once compensated means the error in the evaluation is reduced by roughly
 * `1 / Number.EPSILON` which is again roughly `2^53` - it is the same as using
 * double-double precision in a normal Horner evaluation

 * represents the polynomial `5x^2 - 3x`
 * @param x the value at which to evaluate the polynomial
