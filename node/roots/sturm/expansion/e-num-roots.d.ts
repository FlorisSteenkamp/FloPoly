/**
 * Returns the *exact* number of *distinct* real roots in the open interval (-∞,+∞)
 * of the given polynomial.
 *
 * * roots with multiplicity are counted only once, e.g. the polynomial `(x - 1)^3`
 *   has exactly one distinct real root, namely `1`.
 *
 * * returns `0` for a non-zero constant polynomial and `Infinity` for the
 *   zero polynomial (which has infinitely many roots)
 *
 * @param p a polynomial with coefficients given densely as an array of
 * Shewchuk expansions from highest to lowest power, e.g. `[[5],[-3],[0]]`
 * represents the polynomial `5x^2 - 3x`
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const p = [[1], [1], [-64], [236], [-240]];
 * eNumRoots(p); //=> 4
 * ```
