# Installation
## Direct
Download the [minified script file](https://github.com/FlorisSteenkamp/FloPoly/blob/master/dist/flo-poly.min.js) and include it in your project:
```html
<script src='[path-to-file]/flo-poly.min.js'></script>
```
There is also a [map file](https://github.com/FlorisSteenkamp/FloPoly/blob/master/dist/flo-poly.min.js.map) and a [non-minified version](https://github.com/FlorisSteenkamp/FloPoly/blob/master/dist/flo-poly.js) available.

## Bower

From the command line, navigate to your project root and type:
```cli
bower install flo-poly --save
```
Include the script in your project:
```html
<script src='bower_components/flo-poly/dist/flo-poly.min.js'></script>
```
## Usage
After having included the script file in your HTML there will be a new global viariable available called `FloPoly` that represents the library. See the [docs](http://mat-demo.appspot.com/#!/test-polynomials#docs).
